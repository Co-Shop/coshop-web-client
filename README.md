**ðŸš§ UNDER CONSTRUCTION: We just started working on this about a week ago, a very late start for the hackathon. We've made some decent progress though and will probably continue working on it after the hackathon is over. ðŸš§**

This is the web front-end of Co-Shop, a Covid-19 project made to make shopping for essential items easier and reduce time spent in public. It's a universal web app designed with a mobile first approach using the full Vue suite and Nuxt.
